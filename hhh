With reference to the following program:

     exit(1);

} 

main()
 
{
   int pid;
   pid = fork();

                  }
   fatal ("fork failed");
 }


Which of the following explanations about the program, when it is run, is correct?

Option A
After forking the program checks to determine if the process is the child or parent. If it is the child, the process waits for a while and then terminates. The parent then runs and prints the error messages  "execl failed" and "fork failed".

Option B
After forking the program checks to determine if the process is the child or parent. If it is the child, the process waits until the child process exits. The parent then runs and prints the error message  "execl failed".

Option C
After forking the program checks to determine if the process is the child or parent. If it is the parent the process waits for a while and then terminates. The child then runs and prints the error message "fork failed".

Option D
After forking the program checks to determine if the process is the child or parent. If it is the parent, it is blocked on the wait() command and the child process then becomes active. The child then runs and overwrites the current process with the ls -l process. The child completes and the parent then wakes up and prints "ls completed".

simpfork: pid = 914
Did a fork.  It returned 915.  getpid = 914.  getppid = 381
Did a fork.  It returned 0.  getpid = 915.  getppid = 914

Which is the child process, and why?

Option A
The second line is the child process. i.e.

( Did a fork. It returned 0. getpid = 915. getppid = 914), 

because it returned 0.

Option B
The first line is the child process. i.e.

( Did a fork. It returned 915. getpid = 914. getppid = 381), 

because it returned 915 which was created later than 0.

Option C
The first line is the child process. i.e.

( Did a fork. It returned 915. getpid = 914. getppid = 381), 

because it ran first.

Option D
The second line is the child process. i.e.

( Did a fork. It returned 0. getpid = 915. getppid = 914),
